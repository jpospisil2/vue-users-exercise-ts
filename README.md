2. Display the list of user's and show the following information for each:
    * Name
    * Status checkbox
        * Should be checked if `active` is true

3. Add functionality for adding a new user to the list.  Allow a name to be entered, and chose a default for `user.active` status.
       
4. Allow list to be filtered to only active users.
